👋 Hi, I’m @psshibuya
👀 I’m interested in UX/UI design, product ownership, and digging into research...and diving deep into science!
🌱 I’m currently learning more about UX strategies and UI trends.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that blend design and technology.
📫 How to reach me... hit me up here or on my sns.
😄 Pronouns: she/her
⚡ Fun fact: I'm a PhD in ecology, so I have a serious passion for science! I dabble a bit in R from my research days, which keeps things interesting!
